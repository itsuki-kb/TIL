### Markdown practice

# Heading
  H1: # heading  
  H2: ## heading  
  H6: ###### heading  
  (In order to change line, add 2 spaces at the end of each line.)
  

# Quotation
  > Normal Quotation by 1 >  
  >> Nested Quotation by 2 >>  
  >  > In order to start a new line, just add double spaces.  
  >  > How can I get out of this nested quotation?
>  > 
  > After making a blank line, use just one > sign. 

# Word Defition
  <dl>
    <dt>What is Markdown?</dt>
    <dd>It is a kind of file end with .md.  
      In addition to writing TIL, README in github can be written in this way.</dd>  
    <dt>Syntax?</dt>  
    <dd>Enclosure by **&lt;dl&gt;**, and inside put *&lt;dt&gt;`* for definition term and *&lt;dd&gt;* for data description.</dd>  
    <dt>Emphasize</dt>  
    <dd>In the last sentence I used emphasize. Just enclosure 1 or 2 * !</dd>  
    <dt>Escape sequence</dt>
    <dd>In order to write markup tag in a sentence, & lt ; will be the opening tag, while & gt ; will be closing one.</dd>  
  </dl>  

  ***
  3 * will be a horizontal line!

# List up
* list 1 by using one *  
  * list 2 just indenting with one *  
* list 2

I can put link just by pasting like this:  
https://qiita.com/oreo/items/82183bfbaac69971917f

or if I want to show a specific sentence as a link, it will be like this:  
[Reference Qiita page](https://qiita.com/oreo/items/82183bfbaac69971917f)  
> Use square brackets for the sentence, use parenthesis for the URL.
